Installed Splunk enterprise on Oracle Vm virtual box Version 7.0.2 r154219 (Qt5.15.6)
Running Linux (Parrot Os Home edition - 5.1.2 Electro Ara)

1 - Starting splunk and the dashboard

2 - Using search on an internal index to show logs in a table form and looking at the details

3- Adding a CSV file to be monitored. Then performing search on it and looking at entry details

4- Added the /bin directory to be monitored on Splunk. Then inspecting logs and their details

5- Creating a new index, sample_index which will monitor the /home directory.
Then we can view some of the commands I had previously ran on the terminal. such as,
cd bin
./splunk start 
etc as seen in the video
At the end I have listening ports open on the terminal which show splunk occupying port 2776

6- Continues previous video. Showing the newest logs that were monitored and stored in sample_index. We can also see that 279 events were monitored today, on the timeline
